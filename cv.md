About Myself:

 My interest in computer topics manifested itself in my youth, when I started sorting out computers and laying a optical network around the house.
Over time, I learned not only to break, but also to repair such things. Later, I took an interest a little deeper and started to learn network engineering,
operating systems on the linux kernel and also began to repair computer equipment (even had a chance to work in a repair service).
And today I realized that writing code is my thing (at least it still seems so) and that's how I came to the course from the guys from
RS Schools=).
 From my strong qualities, in my opinion, I would single out purposefulness and perseverance. Because when I get interested in something,
then I am ready to study the topic I like for hours and nights. This is exactly what is happening now with the study of course materials.
